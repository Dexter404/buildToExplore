## AlertInBootstrap

**Aim**: To use Bootstrap alert as [JavaScript popup boxes](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_popup.asp).

#### Overview:
- JavaScript has three kind of popup boxes: Alert box, Confirm box, and Prompt box.
- But drawback with them is we can style/modify them as per our application requirements.
- So for this reason, I created these Bootstrap based popup boxes using Bootstrap alert component.

#### Features/Functionalities Implemented:
- [x] Created alert boxes which can be displayed using `info`, `warn`, `success` or `error` functions and disappear automatically after 6 seconds.
- [x] Created confirm boxes which can be used to take feedback/confirmation from user before proceeding further tasks.

#### Dependencies:
- jQuery
- Bootstrap 3
